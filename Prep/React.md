So I have been working on React projects and i know Js concepts clearly now. Now what I want is detailed topics lists from beginner to advance covering each and every topic which could possibly be in REACT from the start to end. So that I can master REACT js. I need just the list of the topics and nothing else. No matter how long it takes I want all the topics to be covered init. Just list the topics which I should be covering inorder to master REACT js.
